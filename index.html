              Joel Kimakwa is from Kenya and dreams of being a professional
              football player. He started playing when he was 10 years old in
              primary school. His coach trained him to be good at attacking
              positions like winger, striker, and attacking midfielder. Joel
              loved football even more after that. In high school, he faced many
              challenges, but he didn't give up on his dream.
              <br />Finally, in Form 2, he got the chance to play for the school
              team because of his hard work and dedication. After high school,
              Joel still wanted to pursue football. He got selected for a fourth
              division team after playing for a subcounty team. Being scouted by
              Afc Leopards youth team academy was amazing for Joel because it
              brought him closer to his dream of being a pro footballer.
